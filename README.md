## Architecture

Development Tools.
- We are using Github for our version control system (VCS).
- We are using VSCode as our IDE and NPM as our package manager.

Frontend
- HTML provides the skeletal structure of our project, where CSS offers the visual styles and layout.
- React allows for handling dynamic user interactions, and rendering complex UI elements. Its' component-based architecture allows for reusable UI components, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

Backend
- Node.js is an efficient and scalable platform for building server-side applications. It handles server-side logic, business operations, and database interactions. The asynchronous nature of Node.js will support high throughput and fast response times.
- Forms and file systems are integrated and tested through User Input, MongoDB, and Express.js.
