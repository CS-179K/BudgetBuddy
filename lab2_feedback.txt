"Large scalability and throughput."
You probably don't want to tackle scalability in this kind of project.
// Unless your planning on deploying on cloud. But that would amount to a very large project in an of itself.

In general we don't really have time to test some of these non functional requirements.
// But it does look good in docs ^_^;;

Great job on the documentation. I think most managers would look over it and think everything is fine.

But I won't lie it does worry me a bit.
Really do check the banking API's.
I know I'm harping on it, but we need to know asap if we need a backup plan.

It would be good if you could figure out the banking API situation by lab Thursday.
On Thursday we're going to do a UI wireframe, and DB Schema.
